I'm a robotics engineer with a strong foundation in Reinforcment Learning, Computer Vision, and Data Analysis. I earned my M.S. in Robotics and B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Oregon State University, where I’ve worked on projects ranging from training dexterous manipulation policies in that survive the sim-to-real transfer, to building real-world autonomous systems. My work has included training convolutional neural networks for keypoint detection, implementing vision-guided control with robotic arms, and developing autonomous navigation for mobile robots using Lidar and camera data.

Before grad school, I served in the U.S. Navy as a Nuclear Electronics Technician, where I gained experience troubleshooting complex electronic systems and maintaining equipment in high-stakes environments. I bring a mix of research, practical engineering, and technical problem-solving to every project. I’m comfortable working across software and hardware, and enjoy building systems that bridge the gap between simulation and the real world.
