I'm a robotics engineer with a strong foundation in Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, and Data Analysis. I earned my M.S. in Robotics and B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Oregon State University. I’ve worked on projects ranging from training dexterous manipulation policies that survive the sim-to-real transfer to building autonomous systems. My work has included training convolutional neural networks for keypoint detection, implementing vision-guided control with robotic arms, and developing autonomous navigation for mobile robots using LiDAR and camera data.

Before grad school, I served in the U.S. Navy as a Nuclear Electronics Technician, where I gained experience troubleshooting complex electronic systems and maintaining equipment in high-stakes environments. I bring a mix of research, practical engineering, and technical problem-solving to every project. I’m comfortable working across software and hardware, and enjoy building systems that bridge the gap between simulation and the real world.
